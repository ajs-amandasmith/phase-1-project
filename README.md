## Choose Your Pokemon Team

### Instructions

This is a way to choose your own Pokemon team.

The user can search for a pokemon by their name or national pokedex number.

Click the pokemon's name to populate the pokedex form and check out if this is a pokemon you'd like on your team.

If yes, click the 'Add Pokemon?' button to bring up another form.

The user can give your pokemon a nickname, pick its gender (based on the pokemon species), and if the user would like the pokemon to be a shiny variation.

Submitting this data replaces a pokeball with the pokemon and the data you submitted. (The sprite will be the shiny variant if shiny was selected. If it wasn't then the sprite will be the gender chosen by the user.)
